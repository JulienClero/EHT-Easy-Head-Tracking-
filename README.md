# EHT (Easy Head Tracking)

A DIY head tracking system using ESP32 and MPU6050 for gaming and simulations, compatible with OpenTrack.

## 🎯 Features

- **3DOF Tracking**: Yaw, Pitch, Roll with gyroscope and accelerometer
- **WiFi Transmission**: Real-time UDP data streaming
- **Complementary Filter**: Eliminates drift on pitch/roll
- **Start Up Yaw Calibartion**: Minimizes yaw drift
- **Low Latency**: Less than 20ms end-to-end
- **OpenTrack Compatible**: Plug & play with games and simulators

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Prepare Environment
```bash
# Install Arduino IDE
# Add ESP32 support:
# File > Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs
# https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```

### 2. Configure Code
```cpp
// Modify these variables in the code:
const char* ssid     = "YOUR_WIFI";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
IPAddress pcIP(192, 168, 1, XXX);  // Your PC IP
```

### 3. Flash ESP32
- Select board: `ESP32 Dev Module`
- Select serial port
- Make modifications to the code : Fill in your wifi ssid, password and your PC's IP adress (2. Configure Code)
- Compile and upload

## 🎮 OpenTrack Configuration

### 1. Install OpenTrack
Download from: https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases

### 2. Configuration
1. **Input**: `UDP over network`
   - Port: `4242`
   - Bind address: `0.0.0.0`

2. **Output**: Choose according to your game
   - `freetrack 2.0 Enhanced` (most games)
   - `TrackIR` (for compatible games)

3. **Mapping**: Adjust to your preferences

### 3. Use
- Switch on your EHT
- Stay still while it calibrates (10 sec default)
- Start OpenTrack
- Click "Start"
- You should see the octopus move with your head


## 📊 Performance

- **Frequency**: 100Hz (10ms per sample)
- **Total Latency**: < 20ms
- **Accuracy**: ±1° (pitch/roll), ±2° (yaw)
- **Drift**: None on pitch/roll, slight on yaw

## 🔧 Advanced Settings

### Sensitivity Adjustment
```cpp
// In code, final lines:
headData[0] = yaw * 2.0;   // Multiply for more sensitivity
headData[1] = pitch * 3.0;
headData[2] = roll * 3.0;
```

### Complementary Filter
```cpp
const float alpha = 0.99f;  // 0.95-0.99 recommended
// Closer to 1.0 = more responsive but more noise
// Closer to 0.9 = more stable but less responsive
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues
- Check SSID/password
- Verify ESP32 is on same network
- Restart router if necessary

### Angle Drift
- **Pitch/Roll**: No drift (complementary filter)
- **Yaw**: Normal drift without magnetometer
- Solution: Recalibrate with `Ctrl+Home` in OpenTrack

### Erratic Data
- Check I2C connections
- Add decoupling capacitors if needed
- Verify stable 3.3V power supply

### High Latency
- Reduce `LOOP_INTERVAL_MS` (watch CPU load)
- Use 5GHz WiFi if possible
- Disable WiFi sleep mode
